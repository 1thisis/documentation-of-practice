- Description: Screen shot of my research on the definition of hacker ethics. 

The first image is a screen shot that i took on my computer while I am watching the documentary Unauthorized access, this is a documentary about the forming and early history of ther hacker culture in 90s. This film created a window for people like me to learn about the people, the personalities, and the intentions behind each computer and each hacking actions. Which lead meto. the question of what is reeally people's intention to hack? Then, I ran into the webiste Catb.org, a website named after  Cathedral and the Bazaa. this is a website that defines terms in hacking culture, and give shelter to hackers or people interested in the hacking culture. In here, I found the word : hacking ethic, a word defined a protocal thart may or may not being practiced by hackers. As i look in deeper into the definition of hacker ethic, i realized its a really vague idea. And it is not necessarily functioning as the protocal of hacking as it should be, due to the vagueness of the definition and how controversial it is. This realization had generated desire to lear4n more about how i can improve that. Therefore, i got the second screen shot.
