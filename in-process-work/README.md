- Description: This is one of the first sketches I produced using special software I found online called emoji.ink

Inspired by the early ASCII art portraits I found in my research on emoticons, I decided to create portraits using emojis. My first attempts were produced using Snapchat, but it was very difficult to get the level of detail I wanted. After further research I found an online application called emoji.ink, developed by an Internet artist named Vince McElvie. It's this app which I used to produce the sketch seen above. My initial sketches were focused on specific facial features (eyes, nose, lips). I made numerous sketches of these close ups to practice drawing with emojis until I had developed a style I felt had the right degree of "photo realism", or at least as representational as one can get with emojis.
